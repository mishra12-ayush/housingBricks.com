    maindescription: 'As you open the front door to this luxury home, you just know it’s been built with quality in mind. Featuring a two-car garage and off-street parking for two more cars, this near city Townhouse will certainly impress. As you enter the home, you are greeted by polished luxury floor tiles to the entrance hallway, with feature floor level wall lights, high ceilings throughout, and modern downlights. Leading through to the large open plan dining and living area the “surprise” begins. Enjoying the same quality flooring throughout, the living space is a delight, lit by modern downlights and plenty of natural light the windows have outdoor protective blinds. Inside, the window treatments are superior Roman blinds with both sheer and block out twins. The café glass fold-away doors open the space to the neat paved outdoor patio with a remote hideaway awning providing weather protection if required . A great entertaining space. The Master Chef kitchen design is of high quality, with Caesar stone benchtops, glass splashbacks, quality cupboards in trendy coffee and cream colors, and a fantastic walk-in pantry. European appliances, a dishwasher of course, plus gas hotplate and electric oven all in stainless steel and produced by Linea will bring out the chef in all. A large separate laundry (not a hideaway as in many townhomes) has plenty of storage plus a separate downstairs WC with vanity, the home also enjoys direct access to the large double garage with auto remote doors. The staircase, with underneath storage, is hidden from view, however with floor level lighting and quality on-trend carpet is a great feature to lead to the second level. Plenty of storage also awaits upstairs, with 3 large bedrooms and a guest bathroom with beautiful Caesar stone vanity, glass shower, and separate bath. Bedrooms two and three have built-in robes and again quality blinds with one perhaps being used as a “work from home” office. The master suite is definitely that, enjoying a very large balcony with treetop views and a large walk-in robe with built-in storage drawers. The ensuite is also a delight, again with Caesar stone benchtops and a twin bowl vanity, a large shower, and quality fittings.  This home has been built for today, with the quality required features such as alarm, reverse cycle air conditioning ducted throughout, slimline rainwater tanks, side by side remote two-door arranging, and quality fittings. Located a mere 10 minutes from the CBD, close to public transport and less than 15 minutes to the beach, this home offers a very enviable lifestyle.  Call for a private inspection, the home is vacant and has had a thorough clean, or call having viewed the 3D walkthrough. I am here to help, with the home now ready for a lucky new owner.',
